<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><i>"I'm a passionate and aspiring web developer with roots in coding that trace back to my college days, where I built a strong technical foundation through hands-on projects and experimentation. 
  That experience sparked a lasting curiosity for how digital systems work and how they can be designed to serve people more intuitively. 
  Over the years, I’ve carried that technical spark into every role
  I've taken on—bringing a developer’s mindset to problem-solving and creative execution."</i></p>

<p><i>"In my six years working in the BPO industry, I’ve cultivated exceptional communication and organizational skills, which seamlessly translate into effective collaboration and clear coding practices.
   I've applied this strength while setting up CRM systems in Excel, resolving support tickets efficiently, and managing structured workflows—all with a focus on usability and performance.
   My experience also includes crafting dynamic video campaigns, merging creativity and technical tools to produce engaging content that drives results."</i></p>

<p><i>"What sets me apart is not just the knowledge I’ve gained, but the mindset I bring to every challenge: adaptable, empathetic, and always curious. 
  I approach web development with both structure and soul—balancing logic with storytelling, and precision with user experience.
